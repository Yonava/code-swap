# Code Swap

Collaboration is a crucial skill in development, but students have few chances to write code together and receive feedback on their code's understandability and readability. Our solution is to create a fun, game-like experience where code understandability is the key to winning.

Teams of two go head-to-head, competing to solve a simple coding problem the quickest. After 60 seconds, code editors are switched around such that each team must build on the opposite team's work. The game ends when a team passes all test cases.

Code Swap is intended for college students, but anyone who is interested in a fun challenge is welcome to play. By mixing in some concepts from a core programming course (_COMPSCI 220 Programming Methodology_), users leave with a better understanding of the core concepts regarding readable code and increased comprehension of class material.

This application was built as a semester-long group project for the course _COMPSCI 426 Scalable Web Systems_ at UMass Amherst.
